### Project Description
A playful, AI-powered face scanner that uses your webcam to detect facial features and generate a humorous ‚ÄúFace Report.‚Äù It analyzes your face shape, counts eyes, nostrils, and ears, then delivers funny, random commentary ‚Äî all in a sleek, minimal white-themed interface. 100% for entertainment, no data stored.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People everywhere lack instant AI-powered analysis of their face shape, number of nostrils, and ear count ‚Äî along with the humorous feedback they never knew they needed.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A sleek AI scanner that instantly counts your facial features and roasts you with witty, unnecessary commentary ‚Äî finally solving a problem you didn‚Äôt even know existed

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- face-api.js, TensorFlow.js, HTML5 Canva API
- Bolt.new, Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome/Any Modern Browser, Github Pages, Webcam
- 
### Implementation
For Software:

Uses face-api.js for real-time face and landmark detection in the browser.
Accesses webcam via getUserMedia and overlays detection on canvas.
Estimates face shape and counts facial features from landmarks.
After a short scan, displays a Face Report with funny, randomized commentary.
Fully browser-based with a clean, white-themed UI.

# Installation
1. Open terminal
2. Create a project folder:

```bash
mkdir face-analyzer && cd face-analyzer
```

3. Create an index.html file (or paste your full code there)
4. Open in browser:

```bash
open index.html         # macOS  
# OR  
start index.html        # Windows  
# OR  
xdg-open index.html     # Linux
```

üåê‚ÄÇTo serve it locally with a lightweight server (optional):

Using Python (if installed):

```bash
# Python 3.x
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

üì¶‚ÄÇIf using npm or building with a framework (not required):

```bash
npm init -y
npm install face-api.js
```

# Run
üñ•Ô∏è‚ÄÇRun Command (for local use)

If you have Python installed:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```arduino
http://localhost:8000
```

This runs a lightweight local server so the webcam and face-api.js models load correctly (some browsers block webcam on file:// URLs).
