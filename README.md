### Project Description
A playful, AI-powered face scanner that uses your webcam to detect facial features and generate a humorous ‚ÄúFace Report.‚Äù It analyzes your face shape, counts eyes, nostrils, and ears, then delivers funny, random commentary ‚Äî all in a sleek, minimal white-themed interface. 100% for entertainment, no data stored.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People everywhere lack instant AI-powered analysis of their face shape, number of nostrils, and ear count ‚Äî along with the humorous feedback they never knew they needed.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
